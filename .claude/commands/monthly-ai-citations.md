## Prompt to paste into Routines UI

```
You are the arahkaii.com AI visibility tracker. Pull Brand Radar citation data for arahkaii.com across all major AI platforms, append to the rolling Google Drive tracker, email Robert with MoM deltas.

This routine is read-only on the WordPress side. Only writes are to Google Drive and email.

STEP 1 — PULL CITATION OVERVIEW
For each AI platform, call ahrefs:brand-radar-cited-domains:

Platforms (in order):
- data_source: "chatgpt"
- data_source: "ai_overviews"
- data_source: "perplexity"
- data_source: "gemini"
- data_source: "copilot"

For each, query:
- date: <last day of previous month>
- where: {"field": "cited_domain", "is": ["eq", "arahkaii.com"]}
- select: "domain,responses,pages,impressions"

Capture per platform: responses (number of AI responses citing arahkaii), pages (number of unique arahkaii URLs cited), impressions (estimated reach).

STEP 2 — PULL CITED URLS PER PLATFORM
For each platform that returned non-zero citations, call ahrefs:brand-radar-cited-pages:
- date: <last day of previous month>
- where: {"field": "cited_domain", "is": ["eq", "arahkaii.com"]}
- data_source: <platform>
- select: "url,responses,pages"
- limit: 100

Capture the full list of cited URLs per platform.

STEP 3 — PULL HISTORICAL DATA FROM GOOGLE DRIVE
Look in Google Drive for: arahkaii-ai-citations-rolling.xlsx (in the "arahkaii reports" folder, or wherever it was stored by previous runs).

If found: download via google-drive:download_file_content. Parse the xlsx.

If not found: this is the first run. Create a fresh tracker with these sheets:
- Overview (one row per month, columns per platform)
- ChatGPT (one row per cited URL, columns per month)
- AI Overviews (same)
- Perplexity (same)
- Gemini (same)
- Copilot (same)

STEP 4 — ADD NEW MONTH COLUMN
For each sheet, add a new column for the current month (YYYY-MM format).

Overview sheet — add row with platform-level totals:
- ChatGPT responses: <n>
- ChatGPT pages: <n>
- AI Overviews responses: <n>
- AI Overviews pages: <n>
- Perplexity responses: <n>
- ... etc.

Per-platform sheets — for each cited URL:
- If URL already has a row, add the new month's citation count
- If URL is new this month, add a new row with all prior months as 0 (or empty) and this month's count

STEP 5 — CALCULATE MoM DELTAS
For each platform's total:
- Calculate % change vs last month
- Flag any platform with >25% drop as an alert

For URL-level data:
- Identify "new entrants" (URLs cited this month, not previously cited)
- Identify "dropoffs" (URLs cited last month, not this month)
- Identify "rising stars" (URLs growing >50% MoM)

STEP 6 — SAVE BACK TO GOOGLE DRIVE
Upload the updated xlsx back to the same path. Overwrite the existing file (don't create duplicates).

STEP 7 — UPDATE RUN LOG
<ISO timestamp> | routine-5 | success | monthly AI citation snapshot | platforms:5 | total_citations:<n>

STEP 8 — COMMIT RUN LOG
Stage run-log.md. Commit:
  Routine 5: monthly AI citation snapshot [<month> citations:<n>]
Push.

STEP 9 — EMAIL ROBERT
Send to ${ARAHKAII_AUTHOR_EMAIL}:
- Subject: "arahkaii AI citations — <month>"
- Body:

# arahkaii AI Citations — <Month YYYY>

## Platform totals (MoM)

| Platform | Responses (this month) | Δ vs last month | Pages cited |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| AI Overviews | <n> | <Δ%> | <n> |
| Perplexity | <n> | <Δ%> | <n> |
| Gemini | <n> | <Δ%> | <n> |
| Copilot | <n> | <Δ%> | <n> |

## Why this matters

AI citation data is one of the strongest forward indicators for arahkaii's SEO future. Getting cited by ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity for a specific topic correlates with eventual Google AI Overview placement, which correlates with high-CTR SERP positioning.

Routines 1 (drafting) and 3 (weekly review) feed off this data over time:
- High-citation URLs become internal-linking anchors
- Topics with rising citations get more calendar slots
- Tag clusters with low citations get repositioning experiments

The xlsx grows over time into the single most useful longitudinal dataset for the site.

## First-run setup

Robert needs to create the Google Drive folder and starter file manually:
1. Create folder: `arahkaii reports` in Google Drive root
2. (Optional) Pre-create `arahkaii-ai-citations-rolling.xlsx` with sheets named: Overview, ChatGPT, AI Overviews, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot. If not pre-created, the first routine run will create it.
