# Arahkaii Editorial Reviewer

Hold every draft to the *Tatler Asia + Vogue Arabia + halal-conscious editorial* bar before it touches WordPress.

## Step 0 — Load the foundation

1. `references/brand-voice.md`
2. `references/halal-substitutions.md`
3. `references/editorial-pillars.md`
4. `references/image-system.md` (for image prompts)

## The 9-Layer Review

For every draft, score each layer Pass / Fail / Needs work and provide specific rewrites.

### Layer 1 — Pillar voice fidelity

- Which of the 8 pillars is this? (Style / Beauty / Dining / Travel / Living / People / Culture / Guides)
- Does the draft hold the specific micro-voice for that pillar (VOICE.md §4.1–§4.8)?
- Are pillar-specific banned phrases present?
- Are pillar-specific imagery cues honoured in the suggested visuals?

**Fail trigger:** Draft reads like a generic luxury lifestyle piece rather than the named pillar voice.

### Layer 2 — Banned-phrase scan

Search for:
- Every Tier-1 phrase in VOICE.md §2
- Every Tier-1 phrase in the legacy brand-voice.md (for completeness)
- Pillar-specific bans

**Fail trigger:** Any Tier-1 phrase appears. Reject the draft. Return the list of hits with rewrite suggestions.

### Layer 3 — Halal & substitution compliance

- Does the draft contain ANY mention of alcohol, bar, nightclub, wine, beer, cocktail, champagne, whisky, gin, rum, cognac?
- If the draft is in Dining / Travel / Guides — is halal status declared for every restaurant / hotel / venue?
- Is the halal lens matter-of-fact (not apologetic, not preachy)?
- For After-Dark / Evening / Nightlife angles — has the draft applied the Evening Edit substitution?

**Fail trigger:** Any alcohol reference, any missing halal declaration in Dining/Travel/Guides, any moralising tone.

### Layer 4 — The Anti-AI-Slop Checklist (VOICE.md §6)

Run all 11 boxes. Two or more failures = rewrite the offending sections from a specific scene.

### Layer 5 — Opening 100 words

- Does the draft open with a scene, not an adjective?
- Can the reader picture what's in front of them by the end of sentence one?
- No headline restatement?
- No "in today's…", no "are you looking for…", no question-as-clickbait?

**Fail trigger:** Generic opener. Rewrite the lede entirely using one of VOICE.md §1's good-open patterns.

### Layer 6 — Specificity audit

For every paragraph, ask: *could this exact wording describe ten different brands / hotels / restaurants?* If yes, that paragraph is filler.

- Designer names, hotel names, dish names, neighbourhood names, prices, dates — are they specific and recent?
- Any vague claim without a named source?
- Any descriptive word that could be cut without losing meaning?

**Fail trigger:** Three or more paragraphs that read as filler.

### Layer 7 — Structural compliance

- Word count ≥ 800?
- Article matches one of the 5 locked templates?
- 5–8 internal links from `references/url-database.md`?
- H2s are specific (not "The Vibe", "The Experience", "The Verdict")?
- Each H2 section opens with a standalone, extractable sentence (for AI Overview)?
- Concludes on a forward image / quiet recommendation / sharper-thought-than-the-start — not "what do you think?"

### Layer 8 — SEO meta check

- `rank_math_title` ≤ 60 chars, ending " | arahkaii"?
- `rank_math_description` 150–160 chars, hook + value + soft pull (no CTA verb)?
- `rank_math_focus_keyword` lowercase, one phrase?
- Primary keyword appears in H1, first paragraph, and at least one H2?

### Layer 9 — Image prompt validation

If the draft includes featured / inline image prompts:
- Each prompt uses one of the 24 locked templates in IMAGE_SYSTEM.md §3?
- Palette is named using IMAGE_SYSTEM.md §1 tokens?
- Anti-slop modifiers (§4) appended?
- Aspect ratio specified?
- Never-images list (§5) clean?
