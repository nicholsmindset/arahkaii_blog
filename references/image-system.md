# Arahkaii Image System — moodboard-locked, anti-AI-slop

> *Every AI-generated or stock image used on Arahkaii must pass this system. The goal is to look like editorial photography from a real magazine — not "AI generated lifestyle".*

Loaded by `arahkaii-featured-image-prompt`, `arahkaii-social-media-creator`, `arahkaii-publisher`, `arahkaii-editorial-reviewer`.

## 1. THE LOCKED PALETTE

Every image must read in one of these palette families. If the dominant colours fall outside, reject and regenerate.

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Paper | `#F4F0E7` | Background, walls, linen, plates |
| Warm Paper | `#EBE3D4` | Warmer wall, fabric, paper |
| Taupe | `#E4D8C9` | Mid-tone walls, raw wood, terracotta tile |
| Clay | `#71613E` | Earthenware ceramics, brushed brass, leather |
| Ink | `#26321C` | Deep olive accent, foliage, fabric |
| Sage | `#8C9274` | Plant tones, dried herbs, ceramics |
| Rose Clay | `#B98D74` | Skin tones, terracotta, dried roses |
| Gold | `#C9866F` | Warm metallic, candlelight, golden hour |
| Black Tea | `#1E1B18` | Black accent, dark wood, low-light scenes |

**Banned colours:** neon, electric blue, primary red, primary yellow, hot pink, lime green, fluorescent anything. Even as small accents.

**Forbidden lighting:** harsh overhead fluorescent · ring-light glare · over-saturated HDR · "magic hour" beach photos with sun flares · nightclub lasers · bar mood lighting (red/purple wash).

## 2. THE 8 ANTI-SLOP RULES (every image must pass)

1. **No "AI sheen"** — that plasticky, over-smooth, slightly-melted quality. Force grain, film texture, or imperfect surface.
2. **No floating fingers, six-fingered hands, or extra limbs.** Reject any image with hands unless the hands are anatomically correct.
3. **No symmetrical perfection on faces.** Editorial faces have asymmetry, pores, real skin texture.
4. **No generic "wellness woman in a robe with a green smoothie".** No "businesswoman with a folder smiling at the camera". No "happy diverse group laughing over salad". These are AI-slop and stock-slop tells.
5. **No cluttered compositions.** Editorial = negative space. If you can't see at least 30% of the frame as breathing room, it's too busy.
6. **Composition follows rule of thirds, never centred mug-shot framing** (unless it's an intentional portrait with editorial styling).
7. **No text in the image.** All text overlays are done in post (Canva/Figma).
8. **One subject focus per image.** Multiple competing focal points = scroll-past.

## 3. CATEGORY-LOCKED PROMPT TEMPLATES

Each pillar has 3 locked prompt patterns. Use these as the base, then swap the bracketed variables. **Do not invent new patterns** — that's where slop creeps in.

The structure for every prompt:
```
[Subject + scene], [Style anchor], [Light direction], [Composition], [Palette], [Texture], [Camera/lens], [Anti-slop modifiers]
```

## 8. THE 60-SECOND IMAGE REVIEW (after generation)

For every generated image, before using:

1. Open the image at full size. Does it look like editorial photography or like AI?
2. Are the hands and faces anatomically correct?
3. Is the palette inside the locked tokens?
4. Is there at least 30% breathing room (negative space)?
5. Is there any alcohol, club lighting, or banned subject?
6. Would this look at home in *Tatler Asia* or *Vogue Arabia*?
7. Is there grain / texture, or is it that smooth AI plasticness?

If any answer fails, **regenerate**. Don't ship slop.
